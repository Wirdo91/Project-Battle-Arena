	Be able to place blocks - done
	Be able to select blocks(for placing traps) - done
		Have block(like in tetris) where middle is transparent
		Place block on top of block to show selection
	Have restricted number of items

Make game play
	Implement physics based movement - done'ish
	Make sure friction causes max speed
	Test Ice/Sludge friction - done'ish
	Make traps hidden until collide
		Should only be a visual thing
	Make phases of the game
		Game phase
		Design phase
	Intro screen

	Make Spawn actually spawn
		Check if players are connected 
	
	Make initial weapon
		Check/adjust knockback
		
Make multiplayer
	Implement multiplayer connection

	...


2-4 person arena
Square 5-7x5-7

Each round, each player gets 5 blocks to place
	3 ground blocks
	2 User chosen
	
Blocks 
	Ground
	Trap
		Fall blocks
			The block falls when a player steps on it.
		Ice block
			The block turns to ice, when a player steps on it.
			Ice removes all friction, so the player slides
		Spike block
			When a player steps on the block, the player gets stuck on spikes from the ground

Player controls
	The player moves around with the arrow keys/wasd
	The player attacks with space(maybe mouse button(more precise attacks - still on the cardinal directions))
	Should the player be able to jump?
	
	Technical:
		Movement should be physics based
		Capsule collider on the player indicates collision with ground/traps
		Add speed using arrow keys/wasd
		while movement is not null, find direction and update animation
		Player can not attack while adding movement (could make attacks possible on ice)
		
		Should the camera angle be different per player
			i.e. should the players see from each of his corners
			
		Should movement be restricted to cardinal directions? or be octo directional?
		
Weapons
	Each player can select a weapon on battle start
	When hit by a weapon, a knockback value is applied to the player (Used to push players of the arena)
	Weapons available:
		Sword
			Hit a half circle in player facing direction (can hit multiple players)
		Spear
			Hits a straight line forward (better range than sword)
		Bow
			Fires an arrow forward (possible max distance)(Should have less stopping power than melee weapons)
			
Lose condition
	Falling off the arena platform
	(Should players have health)
	(Health could also result in staggering)
	
Arena platform
	Battle platform consist of X blocks
	Each block can be stood upon
	4 blocks (one in each corner) indicates starting positions
		These cannot be traps
		(possibly 3x3 around the starting area)(would need bigger arena)
	Technical
		Each block is sized as a primitive cube in Unity
		Each block have a collider to work with the player/game/traps
		Each block can have a trap on it
			Trap can be either active or inactive
			(one use of multiple uses)
		Should the player be able to see where his own placed traps are placed?
		Should trap locations carry over between rounds (if unused only? or always)
		Should trap locations be revealed between rounds (kind of needed, otherwise traps could be placed on top of each other (Could be a tactic to try to find trap locations))
			
		Arena editor
			Full gridbased map have a collider to be used by the level generation
			This collider is exclusivly used to recognize clicks
			The arena should not be destroyed between level
				Thus the level editor (between rounds) can use the same arena
			Should have a bar showing available blocks and block selection
